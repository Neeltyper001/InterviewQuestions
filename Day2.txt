Undeclare vs Undefined
- Undeclare : There is no variable
- Undefined : There is variable but not assigned any value
- Accidently global: for example g= 10
- window is the global object

Is everything is object in js?

Null vs undefined
- typeof Null is object , typeof undefined is undefined
- Null states the object is no longer referenced but undefined states there is no variable

== loose comparison operator (type conversion then compare)
=== strict comparison operator (directly compare the types)

10 + undefined gives NaN
10 + null gives 0

What is coercion?
- In dynamic typed language when one type is converted into another implicity
- For example 
		String + number = String
		Number + String = String
		Number + null = number
		Number + undefined = number
		undefined + null = number
		Number + boolean = number
Consider this
- var e = 100
	e.toString() Why so ? we know that e is a primitive type

To acces the object members...
	- MemberOperator [] also known as associative array
	- dot Operator .

	What is the difference between two?
	 -dot operator cannot access numeric keys means (if we have made numeric keys)
	 -dot operator wont allow string keys having space between them
	 - [] opeartor string keys numeric keys special keys dynamic keys

Difference between
- 'var a = 13' (declare and assigned) and 'a=13' (accidental global)
