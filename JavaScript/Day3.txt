Is everything object in javascript ?
- No, everything is not object in javascript

If primitives are not object then explain this
a.toString()
- at runtime this a is converted into its wrapper types
- it get autobox at runtime,after that it turns into normal primitives.

How many ways to create an object in JS?
- object literal
- var f = Object.create(null)
- var e = new Object()
- spread operator var obj3 = {...obj2}

Spread Operator Vs Rest
- when used to clone object or arrays it is called spread
- when used with functions with n args, becomes rest
